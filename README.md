# Neural-Network-Classifier-and-Regressor-for-Abalone-Age-Prediction

### To determine the age of an abalone, a determining factor of its value in the market, destruction of sample and subsequent thorough examination is required, rendering the process impractical in the real world. In this paper, we propose a neural network classifier, as well as a neural network regressor, to predict the age of abalones, utilising conveniently determinable physical features like dimension and weight. The models were built using abalones dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For programming, python machine learning library sci-kit learn was utilised. Data preprocessing was performed on the dataset prior to model development. Hyper-parameters tuning was conducted to achieve optimal classification performance. Finally, result reveal 64.27% classification accuracy for classification model, 2.163 root mean squared error and 0.552 R-Squared score for regression model.
